Description
===========

   This package provides access to Verilog PLI routines from within
Perl.

       $NET{a_signal} = 1
       do_stop();

   See `man Verilog::Pli' after installation.

Obtaining Distribution
======================

   The latest version is available at `http://www.perl.org/CPAN/'

   Download the latest package from that site, and decompress.  `gunzip
Verilog-Pli_version.tar.gz ; tar xvf Verilog-Pli_version.tar'

Supported Systems
=================

   This version of Verilog::Pli has been built and tested on:

   * sparc-sun-solaris2.6

   * i686-linux-2.2.5

   It should run on any system with Perl and VCS or other Verilog
simulator with minor porting.

Installation
============

  1. `cd' to the directory containing this INSTALL notice.

  2. Type `perl Makefile.PL' to configure Verilog::Pli for your system.

  3. Type `make' to compile Verilog::Pli.  If you are not using VCS and
     get a error about vcsuser.h not being found, you may need to
     change the include of vcsuser.h in perl_cmd.c to veriuser.h.

  4. Type `make install' to install the programs and any data files and
     documentation.

  5. If you have VCS, `cd example ; make' to see an example.


Interpreter
===========

   You will need a perl interpreter inside your simulator to make this
package useful.  A example verilog file, pli C wrapper and all is inside
the example directory.  This example uses VCS, but will work with minor
modifications with Verilog-XL and other Verilog simulators with a PLI.

  1. cd example

  2. make
