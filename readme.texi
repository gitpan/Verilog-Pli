@node Interpreter,  , Installation, Top
@section Interpreter

You will need a perl interpreter inside your simulator to make this
package useful.  A example verilog file, pli C wrapper and all is inside
the example directory.  This example uses VCS, but will work with minor
modifications with Verilog-XL and other Verilog simulators with a PLI.

@enumerate
@item
cd example

@item
make

@end enumerate

Thanks to Tom Kraljevic @email{tomk@@titanic.Abrizio.COM} for this
